WE NEED A FUNCTION THAT WILL TAKE IN THE CURRENT PERSON AS A PARAMETER.

IF THAT PERSON'S ID === ANOTHER PERSON'S PARENT ID, THEN THEY ARE A CHILD TO OUR PERSON. IF THAT CHILD'S ID === SOMEONE ELSES PARENT ID THEN THEY ARE A GRANDCHILD - USE RECURSION TO FIND THIS INFO.

NEED A CASE TO HANDLE SIBLINGS -- TWO DIFFERNT PEOPLE ID'S SHARE THE SAME PARENT ID.

IF OUR PERSON HAS PARENTS WE NEED TO CHECK IF THE PARENTS HAVE PARENTS.
